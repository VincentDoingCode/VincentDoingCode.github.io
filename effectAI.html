        <h2>What is AI?</h2>
        <p>AI is in short an machine or system that mimic human intelligence to perform task and can improve themself base on the information they collect. <br>Some examples of AI are</p>

        <h2>Dangers of AI</h2>
        <p>So how is AI dangerous? Simply the pace of the field of AI is progressing extremely fast and people are worried if there are any precaution for the possibility of AI being uncontrollable.
            We all know the benefit and the capability of AI.

            <p>There are many worries about AI and its potential danger. The list above are just some examples of potential dnager that AI will bring.
                <br>These problems have emerged ever since the world had seen the power of AI. These worries are not alone. Famous Physicist, Stephen Hawking told an audience in Lisbon, Portugal about how the development of AI could be the "worse event in the history of our civilization".

        <p>"AI is far more dangerous than nuke" --Elon Musk</p>
        <p>While not everyone agree with Musk that AI is more dangerous than nukes, what is dangerous is the weapon that AI can control. What if AI could launch nukes? Autonomous weapons that could select targets without human intervention. 
            Autonomous weapons have been described as the third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms. There is also warning and questions about a potential arms race for the devleopment of autonomous weapons. 
            If there is an arms race, autonomous weapons will be everywhere because it can be cheaply mass produced. 
            It will only be a matter of time until they appear on the black market and in the hands of terrorists, dictators wishing to better control their populace, and other non-humane people.</p>

        <h2 id="JobAuto">Job Automation</h2>
        <p>Job Automation is generally viewed as the most immediate threat that come from the advancement of Artifical Intelligence. According to a 2019 Brookings Institution study, 36 million people work in jobs with “high exposure” to automation, meaning that before long at least 70 percent of their tasks — ranging from retail sales and market analysis to hospitality and warehouse labor — will be done using AI.
            This replacement by AI can also be applied to professions that require graduate degrees such as medicine.

        <p>
            Malicious use of AI could threaten digital security, physical security, and political security. 
            Face recognization technology and fingerprint both give away valuable information about oneself that could lead to unknown consequences.
            Inpersonification can also happen with AI.
            Using machine learning, a subset of AI that’s involved in natural language processing, an audio clip of any given politician could be manipulated to make it seem as if that person spouted racist or sexist views when in fact they uttered nothing of the sort.
